## REST API in ExpressJS 

You will create a RESTful API for an online recipe app using Express and Node. 
Your Express app will be served up by a Node server running on port 3000, and it will be reading a json file containing a list of users. 
You will be implementing the following endpoints:
1. GET /api/v1/users â€” The API endpoint will return a list of users from a json file.
2. GET /api/v1/users/[id] - The API endpoint will return a single user from the json file, identied by the id passed in the url parameter

## How To Proceed
Please make sure that you have:
1. node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/)
2. run npm install in your root project folder
3. npm start to run the server
